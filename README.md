# CS: AI
Repository for work done in PSU'S CS Artificial Intelligence Course.

## Homework 1.
The goal of Homework 1 was to create an implementation to compare the BFS and
A\* algorithm. 

## Homework 2. 
The goal of Homework 2 is to create a solution to the 8 Queens problem using
a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In this GA, the mutation is to swap two elements at
random until generationally, a solution had been found. More results can be
found in the writeup attached.

## Final
As the COVID-19 Pandemic set in, I wanted to focus more on enhancing previous
studied material. Thus, I worked on improving the third homework assignment:
Robby the Robot. Robby is a robot that utilizes a Q-Learning Matrix to identify
what the correct action is to do in a hypothetical n x n map where the actions
the robot can perform is to move left, right, up, down, or clear the vacuum.
The robot must not crash into a wall, pick up dirt in a square that is clean,
or not clean in a square that is dirty. 

The final involved tweaking variables common to the Q-Learning rewards
algorithm, and finding what the sweetspot of combinations are and how they
affect the efficiency of Robby the Robot.
